# LocationApp
The intend of this application was that if the user moves more than 50 meters and each time he moved 50 meters to show some kind of message to let him know that.

In the construction of the application firstly I tried to implement a MVVM pattern. Later I found out that for this little application a simple MVC pattern was enough.
To test this application I used the emulator so to try the moving part was a little bit tricky. I have an iPhone so I couldn't test it out...

I only implemented the changed position by a clicker button.
